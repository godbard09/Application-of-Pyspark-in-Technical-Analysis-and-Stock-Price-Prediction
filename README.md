# Project Description 
The project aimed to forecast stock prices on the Vietnamese stock market using PySpark for large-scale data processing and machine learning models to predict future trends. We collected and cleaned historical stock data for 20 major stocks listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) from 2020 to 2024. We then applied several advanced machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, CNN, and DNN, to predict future stock prices. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess potential price movements and offer investment recommendations.

# Results:

* The LSTM model provided the most accurate predictions, with performance indicators such as RMSE, MAE, and R2 showing satisfactory results.

* The Monte Carlo simulation offered valuable insights into the likelihood of price increases, aiding decision-making for investors.

# Achievements
* Developed a system that provides actionable insights for investors to optimize their decisions on stock trading.

* Successfully handled large datasets using PySpark, ensuring fast processing and reliable predictions.

# Skills Used:

* Data collection and preprocessing using PySpark

* Implementation of machine learning models for stock price prediction

* Technical analysis using various indicators (e.g., MACD, RSI, SMA)

* Monte Carlo simulation for forecasting stock price volatility
